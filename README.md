# konami-code
small "library" for implementing a Konami Code easter egg on your site. "Enter" takes the place of "Start" in the original code.

To run the demo, first clone the repo, then serve up the `demo/` dir and open your browser.

You can use any simple http server utility, such as `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or `http-server` from npm (`npm install -g http-server`).

## TODO
publish on npm
